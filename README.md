# go-bunnynet

Golang client library for the [bunny.net](https://bunny.net) API. You can find documentation for the API at [docs.bunny.net](https://docs.bunny.net)

This is not an official library. It's written by an independent person, unaffiliated with bunny.net. I'm very inexperienced with Go, so the quality of this library might be pretty bad. Comments, suggestions and improvements welcome.
